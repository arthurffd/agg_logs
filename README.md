## How to run the application:
  1. First of all, extract and unzip LogAggMulti.tar.gz.<br />
  
  2. The application already contains a sample of http server logs files, but you can add more log files in the following directories (each one represents log files from different servers):
    *.\http_logs\server_01
    *.\http_logs\server_02
    *.\http_logs\server_03
    *.\http_logs\server_04
  
  3. Execute the script "start.sh" <br />
